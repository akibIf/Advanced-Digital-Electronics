# Advanced Digital Electronics

This repository contains practical session materials and code examples for the course on Advanced Digital Electronics. The practical sessions cover various topics related to digital logic design and implementation. Below is an overview of the practical sessions and their corresponding topics.

## Practical Session: TD2 - Realization of Arithmetic Operator
- In this session, we explore the implementation of arithmetic operators using digital logic circuits.
- Code examples and circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division will be provided.

## Practical Session: TD3 - Realization of Sequential Operator
- This session focuses on the implementation of sequential operators, including flip-flops, registers, and counters.
- Examples of synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits will be covered.

## Practical Session: TD4 - Realization of Finite State Machine
- In this session, we delve into the design and realization of finite state machines (FSMs).
- The concepts of Moore and Mealy machines, state diagrams, and state tables will be discussed.
- Code examples and circuit implementations of FSMs will be provided.

## Practical Session: Realization of a Data Path and a State Machine
- This session combines the concepts of data paths and state machines to create more complex digital systems.
- We will explore the integration of data paths and FSMs to implement advanced functionality.

## Practical Session: TD7-8 - Design of a Frequency Divider based on a Gray Code Counter
- In this session, we focus on the design and implementation of a frequency divider using a gray code counter.
- Code examples and circuit designs for frequency division will be covered.

## Practical Session: TD9 - Synthesis of a Frequency Divider based on a Gray Code Counter
- This session builds upon the previous frequency divider design by focusing on synthesis techniques.
- We will explore methods to optimize and synthesize the frequency divider design using hardware description languages (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.
